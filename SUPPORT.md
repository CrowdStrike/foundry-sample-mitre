## Issue Reporting and Questions 🐛

Issues may be reported [here](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/foundry-sample-mitre/issues/new/choose) and are used to track bugs, documentation and link updates, enhancement requests and security concerns.

### Issue Formatting (MCVE)

Whenever possible, please try to format issues and questions in the [**M**inimal, **C**omplete, and **V**erifiable **E**xample](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) format. This format reduces "noise", allowing the community to better understand your concern, and provide you with a solution more quickly. This also reduces the likelihood of confidential environment details being accidentally shared within your post.

MCVE formatted code examples provided within issues or questions should be:

- _**Minimal**_: Provide as little as code as possible to produce the problem.
  - Only provide the [statements required](https://matthewrocklin.com/minimal-bug-reports#see-how-small-you-can-make-things) to create an example of the issue.
  - Use simple, descriptive names for functions and variables. Don't just copy your existing code.
  - [Do not include real data](https://matthewrocklin.com/minimal-bug-reports#don-t-post-data). [Mock data examples](https://matthewrocklin.com/minimal-bug-reports#actually-don-t-include-your-data-at-all) to describe the format used, but do not provide real values.
- _**Complete**_: Provide all the necessary programmatic pieces to recreate the issue.
  - Do _**not**_ provide screenshots of code.
  - Use `code blocks` for each file or snippet. Include a description with each block.
  - Provide all error messages received, including the [complete traceback](https://matthewrocklin.com/minimal-bug-reports#provide-complete-tracebacks).
- _**Reproducible**_: Provide code that reliably reproduces the problem.
  - Provide as much detail regarding the problem as possible.
  - Test your example to make sure it produces consistent results.

### Support Escalation

`foundry-sample-mitre` is an open source project, not a CrowdStrike product. As such, it carries no formal support, expressed or implied.

#### Confidentiality

There are also situations where aspects of a support concern cannot be discussed in an online forum, such as:

- customer entitlement
- data sensitivity
- environment configuration

_MCVE format_ is designed to reduce the potential for encountering confidentiality concerns while describing your issue, but cannot speak to every scenario. If one of these concerns impacts your ability to post an issue to this repository, please [contact the CrowdStrike technical support team](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/) directly making sure to highlight the concern as part of your support request.
