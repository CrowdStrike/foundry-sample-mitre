# E2E Testing Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Examined E2E test structure** - Well-established framework with Page Object Model
2. **Fixed authentication issues** - Removed FALCON_BASE_URL from GitHub Actions (was causing Invalid URL errors)
3. **Improved app navigation** - Updated MitreChartPage to look under "Custom Apps" section first
4. **Fixed GitHub Actions configuration** - Properly configured environment variables
5. **Renamed test file** - Changed `mitre.spec.ts` to `foundry.spec.ts` to match working examples
6. **Enhanced launch button detection** - Added multiple selector variations and fallback approaches

## 🔄 Current Status

The E2E tests are mostly working in GitHub Actions:
- ✅ Authentication works (injecting 3 env vars successfully)
- ✅ App deployment and release works
- ✅ App installation works 
- ✅ Navigation finds app in App Manager
- ✅ "View in catalog" link found and clicked
- ❌ **Main Issue**: Can't find launch button in app catalog page

## 🎯 Next Steps with Playwright MCP

Need to use Playwright MCP server to:

1. **Explore the actual app catalog page** - See what the launch button really looks like
2. **Test "Custom Apps" navigation** - Check if app appears there after deployment
3. **Verify direct URL approach** - Test if `/foundry/mitre-vue` works as fallback
4. **Check app functionality** - Ensure MITRE matrix elements are accessible

## 📁 Key Files

- `e2e/src/pages/MitreChartPage.ts` - Main navigation logic (lines 131-168 need refinement)
- `e2e/tests/foundry.spec.ts` - Test suite (renamed from mitre.spec.ts)
- `e2e/.github/workflows/e2e.yml` - CI configuration
- `manifest.yml` - App configuration with navigation paths

## 🔍 Investigation Needed

The current launch button selectors to test:
```javascript
this.page.getByRole('button', { name: /launch|open|start|view/i })
this.page.getByRole('button', { name: appName })
this.page.getByRole('button', { name: /install/i })
```

Need to see the actual HTML structure in the app catalog to fix the selectors.

## 🚀 Ready for Playwright MCP Testing

All progress is committed. Ready to start new shell with MCP tools to explore the UI and fix the remaining navigation issue.
